## Project: The Ugly Stepsister - An Unconventional Origin Story

### Narrated by Arthur Pendelton, FAIA

---

My profession is building. I understand foundations, load-bearing walls, the interplay of light and shadow on different materials, and the stories that structures tell across centuries. When I was approached about the project that would become "The Ugly Stepsister," it wasn't via a standard film pitch or a screenplay. It began with a dilapidated manor house and a very peculiar commission.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Site Assessment

### Discovery at Blackwood Manor

My involvement commenced approximately seven years prior to the film's eventual release. I was hired not by a film studio, but by a historical preservation society. They had acquired Blackwood Manor, a rambling, architecturally confused estate with sections dating from the late 17th century through an unfortunate early 20th-century 'modernization'. The brief was to conduct a comprehensive structural survey and propose a plan for stabilization, not renovation. Think of it as architectural forensics.

As we peeled back layers â€“ literal layers of wallpaper, dry rot, and ill-conceived additions â€“ the house began to speak. It wasn't just collapsing; it felt... resentful. Overwhelmed by its own awkward proportions, neglected, and overshadowed by its more aesthetically pleasing (though younger) neighbours on the hill.

The west wing, in particular, was a structural and visual anomaly. Added on awkwardly, blocking original light sources, its entrance obscured by overgrown shrubbery. It was fundamentally sound, built with honest, sturdy materials, but utterly lacking in grace or intention. It felt like an afterthought, a burden on the original, more elegant structure. We started calling it 'the ugly wing' internally.

## Phase 2: Unearthing the Narrative Foundations

### From Structure to Story

The 'ugly wing' became the focal point of our investigation. Why was it built like this? Who commissioned it? Delving into the manor's archives â€“ dusty ledgers, fragmented diaries, overlooked blueprints â€“ revealed a history of familial disputes, inheritances divided awkwardly, and occupants shunted into less desirable spaces.

It wasn't a clean, linear history. It was like finding conflicting stress points in a load-bearing wall â€“ signs of old conflicts embedded in the very structure. The narrative didn't appear on a page; it emerged from the space itself. The feeling of being confined, of being sidelined, of inherent worth being masked by an unappealing exterior â€“ these weren't abstract concepts; they were palpable feelings you experienced walking through that wing.

It became clear that the story wasn't about people inventing a conflict, but about a place imposing a conflict upon its inhabitants. The characters, as they later took shape, felt less like inventions and more like the inevitable expressions of the house's own psychological state: the brittle facade (the 'beautiful' stepsister), the neglected core (Cinderella), and the sturdy, overlooked, fundamentally decent but architecturally maligned section (the 'ugly' stepsister). The narrative structure mirrored the manor's physical layout â€“ sprawling, with hidden rooms and blocked off passages.

## Phase 3: Architectural Blueprints to Screenplay Framework

### Translating Form to Function

My survey reports, detailing the structural 'personality' of each wing, the quality of light in specific rooms, the sound acoustics (or lack thereof), and the sense of spatial injustice, found their way, via the historical society, to a producer with an unusual interest in architecture and place-based storytelling.

He didn't ask for character arcs; he asked about sightlines from the 'ugly wing' windows, the feeling of the oppressive low ceilings, the exact texture of the decaying plaster. He understood that the environment was the true protagonist, and the human characters were merely the agents forced to interact within its confines.

The screenplay, when it finally materialized, wasn't a traditional three-act structure. It felt more like a walk-through of the manor â€“ exploring different rooms, lingering in neglected corners, the plot beats dictated by architectural transitions and the physical limitations imposed by the building. The 'ball' scene, often the climax, felt almost like the outside world briefly crashing into the house's insular, oppressive structure.

## Phase 4: Construction and Finishing - The Filming Process

### Materiality on Screen

I remained involved tangentially during filming, advising on how to capture the 'feel' of Blackwood Manor, even though much of it was shot on soundstages. My focus was on materiality and volume. Ensuring the sets conveyed the same sense of awkward scale in the 'ugly' stepsister's room, the same superficial grandeur of the main hall, the same neglected authenticity of Cinderella's space. The cinematographer and production designer were exceptional; they understood that the walls, the light fixtures, the worn floorboards weren't just backdrop â€“ they were dialogue. The silence of the 'ugly wing' was as significant as any line spoken.

---

## Final Inspection: The Completed Structure

Watching the final film felt less like viewing a movie and more like seeing a complex architectural model brought to life. It captured the spirit of Blackwood Manor's 'ugly wing' â€“ its inherent strength, its awkward placement, its overlooked perspective.

The film isn't just a story about a person; it's a story about a place, and how that place shapes identity and destiny. Its unusual history, rooted not in a writer's imagination but in the very timbers and stones of a forgotten house, is its truest foundation. It stands as a testament to the power of architecture not just to house lives, but to define them.

### Postscript

My work continues. Every building I survey, every site I analyze, whispers potential narratives. Some remain just structures. Others, like Blackwood Manor and the resulting "The Ugly Stepsister," reveal themselves to be stories waiting for someone to unearth their blueprints.
